# X1nput-SOCD-Cleaner

Patch for [araghon007's X1nput](https://github.com/araghon007/X1nput) that cleans Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Directions, hitbox-style.

You can find more about SOCD cleaning in my [VDX SOCD cleaning patch repo](https://github.com/d-hervas/VDX-SOCD-cleaner), and more about X1nput in his repo's README. 

## How to use
Copy XInput1_3.dll into your game's .exe folder. The provided dll only works on 64-bit games. You can build the 32-bit dll by cloning the original project and applying the patch, or just open an issue and I'll upload it for you.
